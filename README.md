# Data Structures and Algorithms II - Exam Solutions

This project contains solutions to a series of algorithmic problems given as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms II** course. The problems are focused on implementing recursive algorithms and understanding basic algorithmic concepts.

## Problems and Solutions

1. **Recursive Sequence Calculation**
   - Implemented a recursive function to calculate the elements of a sequence defined by the following recurrence relation:
     - `a_i = 5` if `i = 0`
     - `a_i = (1/10) * (2 + 2 * a_(i-1))` otherwise
   - The function calculates and prints the first 11 elements of the sequence.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation**
   - Implemented a recursive function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Generalized Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Created a recursive algorithm to generate a generalized Fibonacci sequence based on two input numbers (`c1`, `c2`). The function generates and prints the first `n` elements of the sequence.

4. **Recursive Algorithm Analysis**
   - Analyzed a given recursive algorithm named `Vsetkojedno` and implemented it in C#. The algorithm performs bitwise operations to calculate a specific value based on the binary representation of an input number.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. Open the project in a C# compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. **Run the project** to execute the solutions. You will be prompted to input values where necessary.
4. The outputs will be printed directly in the console.
